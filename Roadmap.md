As of this commit, the game is working as expected.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add Makefile
- [ ] Default grid sizing to 30x30 if cmd line args not passed
- [ ] Default sleep time to 100ms if cmd line arg not passed
- [ ] Add grid presets for phenomena (oscillators, [gosper's glider gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_(cellular_automaton)), etc.)
- [ ] GUI? (maybe)
